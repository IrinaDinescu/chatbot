# ðŸ“Œ **NOTES**

The file is read with the assumption that, in a stock exchange context, prices must always be up-to-date and should not be cached. If the fileâ€™s content were static, caching could have been used to prevent redundant reads. Instead, Iâ€™ve treated file reading as if retrieving real-time data from a database or an external service.
